## About the Project

Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain customers. This project focuses on using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building and training an ANN model using TensorFlow
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas, NumPy, and other dependencies (install via `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/n7kadda/ANN-Churn.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Adjust the ANN configuration in `model.py` if necessary.
3. Run `experiments.ipynb` to train the model and `prediction.ipynb` to evaluate its performance.
